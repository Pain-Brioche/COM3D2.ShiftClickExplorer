# COM3D2.ShiftClickExplorer
A small plugin that allows you to shift click mod items in edit mode to open their paths in windows explorer and copies the menu file name to your clipboard. Vanilla items will only have their file names copied to your clipboard.

This isn't a basic script file for the script loader because of some limitations with the script loader using security permissions modifications.

# Usage
The description above describes it pretty well. You can change the key you hold while clicking in the ConfigurationManager(F1 Menu) or in the config file itself. It may take a few seconds from the time you click to when the folder opens depending on your mod folder size and drive speed.

1. Place the DLL into your `BepinEx\plugins` folder.
2. Done. Shift click an item and watch it go to work.
